# NeuronOBJs
 3D raw model data


The function **bNC.m** does everything we care about.
The commented out material (duplicated here) is useful
%batch Neuron Creator
%masterN = bNC(readPath,fullfile(writePathBase,method),curveRange,method,'timeOne',true)
%readPath = 'E:\Julian\Arbors as they were sent\Basal'
%writePathBase = 'E:\Julian\Rediscovery_9-7-2021\Neurons'
%curveRange = 0:0.25:2;
%method = 'W';  %see pNR for methods
